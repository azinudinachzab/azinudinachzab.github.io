      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Simple Login Page Using MIT AI2&lt;/h1&gt;
(Link on below)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This time i&amp;rsquo;ll share a simple login page using MIT&amp;rsquo;s App Inventor 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to make a login page with hosted database, in this case i separated the PHP file for sign up and login. In the PHP for login i&amp;rsquo;m just using select query which to match the username and password and in the PHP for sign up i&amp;rsquo;m using insert query to add the data from sign up form to the database through GET method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why using GET method instead of POST method? because as far as i know the only interaction of AI2 and the database is through the url, so the only way to insert data is using GET method. And if you&amp;rsquo;ve read my PHP for login and found out that the password is converted to csv table, it&amp;rsquo;s because converting to csv table is the way to deliver data from database to the application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI2 supported convertion from csv table to list, i thought converting the data from database to csv is a good and simple way to get the data. The convertion is featured on list menu, you just need to drag the block thats all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from the client side when you want to do a login or sign up you just need to open the PHP with a GET method addition on the url. The data you want to insert/select is taken from the textbox, so you just modifying the url on the client side program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats all, a simple way to making a login page. You could implementing it on the other mobile IDEs but not recommend it on serious project because of security reason. There are so many way to make a login page on android application, this one is just a sample to explain you the step to make it. If you feel my way to do it is bad and this article cant explain more get up from your bed and kick some code. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World!</title>

      <description>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This is my first time writing in english, so if you look some confusing word or grammar forgive me and just bear with it)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, github said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m intended to start my blog Hello World project today. But im asian, self-introducing and greetings are a must tradition when you meet a new society. So, it’s a good thing if i could killing 2 birds with 1 stone, i’ll introduce myself and do my blog Hello World project in this writing.
My name is Azinudin Achzab, you can call me Azin, Udin or anything you want as long it’s a good nickname. I just an ordinary boy who try to be an extraordinary boy. I’m suck at everything but at least i try hard and harder to be an AAA Game Developer even though i knew i’ll just become a loser in the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a pessimistic jerk, i just tell the truth that all of us are a loser in some way. For example, Mark, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are loser in the eyes of Harvard’s graduates. But the society thought they are a success entrepreneurs. Loser is just a perspective matters, maybe you could see me as a good writer or creative boy but in my eyes i just a loser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the red string, i just finished my efforts to do a personal-branding (thats what my lecturer said) made a github account, made a personal blog, published my story in medium and share my public socmed accounts everywhere in the internet. I did it all because it is a way to become closer and closer to developer life at least if i’m not become a developer in the end i could close to it even just a little.
And you must know the fact that i can do a coding is because i am a student on a state university, my major is computer for education. It’s not like i learn HTML, Java, PHP, Pascal, etc because i liked it, i learned it because i have to do it and i hate the fact that i aimed to be a teacher when i graduated. Becoming a game developer is just a thing i want to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the last line i want you to know that my age is 20th, my bloodtype is A, i am a straight male and my hobby is sleep. I lived in Tangerang Selatan but temporaly i lived in Surakarta/Solo (Jokowi’s born land) because of my study. You can come along take a sip of Angkringan Coffe and do a nice chit-chat with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dont worry about me just worry about yourself, i’m always happy undergo my life even i don’t have a clear path. Nice to meet you! In the end of the words,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h2&gt;
